0. move this folder in the ratox source dir
1. build ratox
2. run your tests

WARNING: spawing a test creates two throw-away IDs, and opens two
connections by default. If starting too much test, it could make it to
the point your router might not be able to forward traffic correctly to
the DHT, rendering your users incapable of seeing each others online.

In case it happens, simply wait for the stale connections to close
themselves, or reboot your computer.
